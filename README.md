# ADA
## 🌟 Ada Adventures 🌟

Welcome! Here I'll be uploading my Ada code as I dive into this awesome, structured language. 🖥️✨ Follow along to see my experiments, learnings, and Ada-powered projects!

## 🌟 Why Ada?

Ada is a fascinating language known for its robustness and reliability, commonly used in critical systems like aerospace and defense. Learning Ada is a great way to understand a structured, strongly-typed language that emphasizes safe and efficient programming practices.

## 📂 Branches

- [Hello-World](https://github.com/Gonzalosilvalde/ADA/tree/Hola_mundo): A branch with hello world code!
- [Functions](https://github.com/Gonzalosilvalde/ADA/tree/Functions): In this branch, I explored defining functions and procedures in Ada.
- [Recursion](https://github.com/Gonzalosilvalde/ADA/tree/recursion): In this branch, I explored the concept of recursion by implementing a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
- [Motion Detection](https://github.com/Gonzalosilvalde/ADA/tree/motion-detection-project): This Ada project implements a motion detection system using OpenCV and a C++ wrapper to analyze video frames in real-time. It captures frames, processes them for motion detection, and saves frames with detected movement, showcasing Ada's concurrency features and image processing capabilities.
- [Alire](https://github.com/Gonzalosilvalde/ADA/tree/alire): Small project to test Alire.


## 📚 Where I Learn

I'm currently exploring Ada through various resources, including:

- **AdaCore Learn**: A great platform for getting started with Ada programming. [Explore here](https://learn.adacore.com/).
- **AdaCore Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on Ada and its features. [Check it out](https://www.adacore.com/documentation#all).

Feel free to check these out if you're interested in learning Ada too! 🌍
