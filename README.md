## ðŸŒŸ Concurrent Traffic Simulation in Ada ðŸŒŸ
Welcome to my Ada project exploring concurrency and task synchronization! This code simulates a traffic intersection where cars and traffic lights coordinate their actions to ensure safe crossing. Through this project, I delved into Ada's concurrency mechanisms, protected types, task entries, and synchronization features, enriching my understanding of Ada's suitability for concurrent programming. Join me as I navigate the world of parallelism and synchronization in Ada! ðŸš—ðŸš¦

## ðŸŒŸ What I Learned in This Project
- Tasking and Concurrency:
Adaâ€™s tasking model enables the creation of concurrent processes (or tasks), each of which can run independently or synchronize with others. I implemented tasks for traffic lights and cars, exploring how tasks can communicate and wait for each otherâ€™s state changes. This helped me understand Ada's unique approach to multitasking, a crucial feature in real-time systems.

- Protected Types for Safe Resource Sharing:
The Intersection protected type acts as a shared resource that cars use to cross safely, one at a time. Protected types in Ada allow for safe concurrent access, ensuring that shared resources are accessed in a controlled, predictable manner. Learning about the role of protected types in managing shared data was particularly valuable for scenarios involving concurrency.

- Task Entries and Select Statements for Synchronization:
To control the traffic light's states and handle requests from cars, I used entries (Change_To_Green and Change_To_Red) within the TrafficLight task. The select statement allowed the traffic light task to selectively accept entry calls based on its current state (red or green). This was a practical application of Ada's built-in synchronization tools, which I found highly intuitive and effective for managing complex task interactions.

- Delay Statements for Real-Time Simulation:
Using delay statements, I simulated realistic delays to represent cars waiting for green lights, crossing, and then clearing the intersection. This enhanced the simulation's realism and highlighted Ada's support for fine-grained timing control, an essential feature for applications in embedded systems and real-time computing.

## âŒ› Future Work âŒ›
In future projects, I plan to create more complex Ada applications using Alire, Ada's package manager and build system. Although I set up Alire for this project, I didnâ€™t utilize its full potential. My goal is to incorporate it more extensively to streamline dependency management and project organization.
